## My process

Planning on paper

Completed HTML

Moved onto CSS - added some CSS reset code

I had to revisit the HTML to change play around with the image and also the .profile-details.

Then CSS all the way for the touchdown.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

I enjoyed playing round with the flex options to achieve what I wanted in the .profile-influence class. 

I had some trouble with the profile image when resizing the page, this was fixed by setting the height to a fixed value and width to auto then setting the image position as absolute. 

### Continued development

Continue learning and doing challenges to improve. 

### Useful resources
